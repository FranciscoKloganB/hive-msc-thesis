Node Degree:
First, the degree distribution is highly related to the robustness of the overlay in the presence of failures as it shows the existence of weakly
connected nodes and massively connected hubs. Second, it is an indication of the way epidemics are spread. Third, it provides an indication of how fairly links are
distributed among nodes, and, as a consequence, an indication of the distribution of resource usage (processing, bandwidth) across nodes.

Small-World Topologies have low-diameter and high peer clustering.

Random Graph Topologies have low-diameter and low clustering. Possible have symmetric peer degrees.

Clustering Coefficient can be viewed as the percentage of neighbors of a peer P who are also neighbors among themselves. High clustering coefficients
may indicate existence of week connectivity of clusters with the rest of the overlay network and also indicate an higher chance of overlay partitioning
in the case of massive node failures or high degrees of churn. It also indicates the existence of more redundant messages within the cluster.
